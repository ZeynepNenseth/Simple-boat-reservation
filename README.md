# Simple-boat-reservation
-- Work in progress--
Simple code that registers boats of certain types and their reservation.
It also calculates the profit of a certain boat and lists the boats according 
to their profit in descending order. 
It should also calculate the maximum number of days a boat was reserved uninterrupted. 
A reservation lasts only one day. If you want to reserve the boat for several days, then you need to make several reservations.
